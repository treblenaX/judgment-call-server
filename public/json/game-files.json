The title for the head of the Mithraic religion is unknown, but second-highest rank is Heliodromus. Lesser ranks or positions in the hierarchy include clerics and monks. Upon the destruction of the Ark of Heaven in 2157, the leader of the Mithraic was killed. Ambrose, possibly a Heliodromus, survived the crash and was the highest-ranking cleric still alive. Per the Mithraic line of succession, Ambrose was automatically elevated to the head of the religion and leader of the surviving Mithraic believers, who referred to him as His Eminence. Following Ambrose's death, leadership would next have passed to Justina, but the Mithraic chose to follow Marcus instead since they believed he was communicating with Sol. When Marcus was exiled, Justina was elevated to her rightful place."

Mother hopes her family will serve as the nucleus for a peaceful, technocratic colony — a new beginning for humanity. But as she struggles to mold these growing humans, she also begins uncovering secrets hidden within her own programming, secrets that could help her protect her family, but could just as easily destroy them."

The sun god Sol was originally a separate god, but Mithras was often worshipped together with Sol Invictus, the unconquerable sun."
